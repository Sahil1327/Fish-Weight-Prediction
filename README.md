# Fish-Weight-Prediction

This project implements a simple web application for predicting the weight of a fish based on its species and physical measurements using a trained machine learning model. The web application is built using Flask for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Flask (pip install flask)
pandas (pip install pandas)
scikit-learn (pip install scikit-learn)
Installation
Clone the repository or download the code.

Install the required Python packages by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Ensure you have the trained machine learning model file (fish_model.pkl) in the same directory as the app.py script. If the model file is missing, run the Jupyter Notebook (train_model.ipynb) to train the model and generate the required fish_model.pkl file.

Start the Flask development server by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
The Flask application will be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open a web browser and navigate to this address to access the Fish Weight Prediction web application.

Enter the required inputs for the species, length1, length2, length3, height, and width of the fish into the respective textboxes.

Click on the "Predict" button to submit the form and get the predicted weight of the fish.

## Front-end
The front-end of the web application is built using HTML and CSS. The index.html file contains the layout and form structure. The CSS styles in the <style> tag within the HTML file (<head>) define the appearance of the elements.

## Acknowledgments
The machine learning model used for prediction is trained using the scikit-learn library. The Flask web framework is utilized to serve the prediction web application.
